Trying to simulate life using Common Lisp language

Unfortunatelly, I was able to finish this project due to **lispbuilder-sdl** not working on our version of Mac OS.
Though, I've spent enough time to get familiar with the **LISP** language and I was impressed by how easily you can add a lot of functionality to your program with few lines of code. 
However, from the readability perspective, I found that conventional languages are easier to understand. LISP could get tricky to read.

Will definitely try again, if they have this Rush open again.
